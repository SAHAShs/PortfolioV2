                    "Geo-Fencing Response System as a Life saver," Final year project based on Raspberry Pi,
                    Arduino, Python helps Ambulance and Emergency vehicles to have nearby traffic signals
                    open for them. So, that they can reach as fast as possible.A project called the Geofencing
                    Response System was created to make it easier for emergency vehicles like ambulances and
                    fire engines to manoeuvre through crowded urban areas' high traffic. The system ensures
                    that emergency vehicles may pass through traffic more swiftly and simply using a mix of
                    Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards, geofencing, and cloud-based communication technologies.
                    This project report addresses the Geofencing Response System's possible uses in emergency
                    scenarios as well as its design, development, and testing.

            <legend><b>Over Speed Vehicle Detection</b></legend>
            <div class="prj-description">
                <p>
                    This system mainly consists of Arduino UNO, two IR sensors, 16x2 LCD display and buzzer. The
                    detected speed is displayed on LCD. Moreover, if the vehicle crosses the limited speed, this system
                    displays the condition of over speed on LCD and the buzzer is alarmed. IR sensors are a large part
                    of a project that detects car speed. Generally, you will be able to use set up IR Sensors on many
                    ways but during this project, we used 2 IR Sensors models and set them 5.0cm apart. When the moving
                    vehicle reaches the main sensor, the IR Sensor is activated. From this moment on, the timer has been
                    started and can still save time until the car reaches the 2nd IR sensor. By imitating the gap in the
                    middle 2 sensors at 5 meters, you will count the speed at which the vehicle has moved from 1st IR
                    Sensor to 2nd IR Sensor as expected to verify the detection in kmph. All statistics and data
                    collection are done in Arduino and therefore the end is shown in the 16X2 LCD display. This route
                    was introduced to detect the speed of the car or a person in general and a warning to people who go
                    along with providing an automatic buzzer.

                <p>
                    A simple To-Do list web application is designed to help users manage tasks by allowing them to input
                    task names and due dates. The application provides a list of tasks with a corresponding delete
                    button for each task. Here's a description of its key features:

                    1. Task Input:

                    Users can enter a task name in a text input field.
                    Users can also specify a due date for the task using a date picker or a text input.
                    2. Add Task Button:

                    After entering the task name and due date, users can click an "Add Task" button to add the task to
                    the list.
                    3. Task List:

                    Below the input section, there is a list that displays all the tasks.
                    Each task is displayed as a list item with the task name and its due date.
                    4. Delete Button:

                    Next to each task in the list, there is a "Delete" button.
                    Clicking the "Delete" button removes the respective task from the list.
